# ShareSp@ce

## Description
ShareSp@ce is the place to share all of your favorite ideas, pictures, videos, and GIFs about 10 of the most popular subjects on the web!  

Upon visiting the homepage of the applictation the user is greeted with a carousel of images,videos, and giphs uploaded by fellow users.  The navigation bar provides the user with options to navigate Home, to the user's Profile, to each of the various Categories, to Create an Idea, or to open a Discord room for a chat.

A user that is not logged in is able to access the home page and various category pages, however, only logged in users are able to access their Profile or Create an Idea.  Navigating to Profile or Create Idea while not logged in redirects the user to the login page.  The user has the option to login or create an account. The login, create account, and logout options are available in the top-right corner of the application.

The Category pages provide a carousel of images, viedoes, or giphs related to the selected category.  Additionally, below the carousel is a table of all the ideas shared in the selected category.  Hitting the 'Content' link inside the table redirects the user to the single page for the idea.  A logged in user is able to add an idea to any category by hitting Create Idea in the side navigation panel.

The user's profile includes a placeholder profile pic, space for the user to provide information about themselves, and the ideas they have posted on the site.
